## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems. You can clone the repo as follows:

```
$ git clone 
$ cd 
```

```
$ bundle _<version number>_ config set --local without 'production'
$ bundle _<version number>_ install
```

Here you should replace `<version number>` with the actual version number.

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, youâ€™ll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
